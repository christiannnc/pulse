## Pulse
I began working on this interpreter for a new programming language in November 2022. My main objective with this project is to learn more about
language and interpreter design. Due to the complexity of building a programming language, it is very likely that this project will never be completed
and will be nothing more than something cool to look back on. 

I plan to work on this occasionally in my free time, and I cannot guarantee that
the code in the repository at any given time is a) the best or most efficient approach; or b) works without error.

## Open Source
This entire project is open source! Feel free to clone, copy/paste, or otherwise use any code in this repository with or without accreditation to
me.
